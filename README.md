DND for now (Do Not Distribute)

Manual:
1 Open your list and copy a section  
2 List should have the format ACCOUNTNAME:PASSWORD  
3 Copy the List into the opened Programm  
4 Press Enter TWICE  
5 Wait until the Programm is done compiling. A Chrome window will open, you can minimize both the Chrome window and the terminal the Programm is running in  
6 Once the Script is done, It will save the results to a file within its own Folder Called "output<Number>.txt"  
7 I recommend renaming that file or moving it to another folder as to avoid misorganization  
8 I dont charge a fee for this, but if you find something big, consider donating :)  
9 For Help, you can reach me under Discord: "heleluja"
